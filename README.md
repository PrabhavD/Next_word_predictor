# Next Word Predictor
A Universal Sentence Encoder project created using Tensorflow Keras combined with tools from Sci-kit Learn and NumPy. Data visualization aided by pandas and seaborn. Allows for predictions of following words to be made by learning the patterns of an input data source (.txt in this case)

## Motivation
To learn how to use the **Universal Sentence Encoder** offered by Tensorflow to train natural-language-processing models and experience ML deployment using Algorithmia

## Libraries/Frameworks Used
* Numpy
* Pandas as pd
* Seaborn as sns
* Tensorflow as tf
  * Keras 
  * Hub - for universal_sentence_encoder
* Matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* Sci-kit Learn
